    "# Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing inflected or derived words to their word stem or root\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means crudely cutting off the end of a word and leaving only its base\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Stemming and Stemmed will be reduced to Stem\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Electricity and Electrical will be reduced to Electr\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Berries and Berry will be reduced to Berri\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Connection, Connective, and Connected will all be reduced to Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes this crude method matches words with diff meanings (e.g. Meanness and Meaning will both be reduced to Mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why might you want to use stemming?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- It reduces the number of words the model is exposed to\n",
    "\n",
    "-- It explicitly correlates words with similar meanings\n",
    "\n",
    "What types of stemmers are there in the NLTK package?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Porter Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Snowball Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Lancaster Stemmer\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Regex Stemmer\n",
